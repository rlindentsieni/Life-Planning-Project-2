     <h1>All About Investment</h1>
        <p>
<b>What investment is:<br></b>
Investment is the act of allocating money or resources with the expectation of generating an income or profit. The primary goal of investing is to increase the value of the original amount invested over time. Investments can be made in various financial instruments, real estate, businesses, and more.

<h3>How Investment Works</h3>

<ol>
<li>Capital Allocation: Investors allocate their capital (money or resources) into different investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or mutual funds.

</li><li>Return on Investment (ROI): The return on investment is the gain or loss generated on an investment relative to the amount of money invested. ROI is usually expressed as a percentage.

</li><li>Risk and Reward: All investments carry some degree of risk, which is the possibility of losing the invested capital. Generally, higher potential returns come with higher risks.

</li><li>Compounding: Compounding refers to the process of earning returns on both the original investment and on the returns that have been reinvested. This can significantly increase the value of the investment over time.

</li><li>Diversification: Diversification involves spreading investments across various assets to reduce risk. This way, if one investment performs poorly, others might perform well, balancing the overall risk.
